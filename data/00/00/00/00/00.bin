《旺达幻视》前情提要
Previously on WandaVision...

19
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:11,490
你根本没有费心隐藏你的超能力
You made no effort to conceal your abilities.

20
00:00:11,490 --> 00:00:14,630
-我不想再躲躲藏藏了  小幻  -你有什么瞒着我的
- Well, I'm tired of hiding, Vis. - What aren't you telling me?

21
00:00:14,630 --> 00:00:15,990
你得阻止她
You have to stop her.

22
00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:18,400
让她停下
Just make her stop!

23
00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:21,120
你不能像控制别人那样控制我
You can't control me the way you do them.

24
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:21,800
是吗
Can't I?

25
00:00:21,810 --> 00:00:23,990
但是她在让这世界上唯一的合成人
She has the world's only vibranium synthezoid

26
00:00:23,990 --> 00:00:26,140
跟她演《郊区版老爸最知道》
playing Father-Knows-Best-In-Suburbia.

27
00:00:26,140 --> 00:00:27,480
等他知道真相后会怎么样
What happens when he learns the truth?

28
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:29,600
你劫持了整个镇的人
You've taken an entire town hostage.

29
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:32,350
拿着枪的人可不是我  局长
Well, I'm not the one with the guns, Director.

30
00:00:39,250 --> 00:00:40,910
我曾经也有一个哥哥
I had a brother.

31
00:00:42,670 --> 00:00:45,120
他叫皮特
His name was Pietro.

32
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:48,340
他是被奥创杀死的
He was killed by Ultron.

33

一位消失很久的哥哥
Long lost bro get to

34
00:00:52,170 --> 00:00:54,690
来给他的臭妹妹一个紧紧的拥抱了

35
00:00:54,700 --> 00:00:57,020
她给皮特重新选角了
She recast Pietro?

第一季  第六集

54
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:29,760
万圣节是个神奇的节日
Halloween's a magical holiday.

55
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:31,680
它的重点是家庭  朋友
All about family, friends, 

56
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:34,160
和可以扮成其他人一天的兴奋感
and the thrill of getting to be someone else for a day.

57
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:37,050
错了  万圣节的重点是糖果
Wrong! Halloween's about candy.

58
00:02:37,050 --> 00:02:39,480
还有吓唬人  但糖果更重要
And scaring people, but mostly candy.

59
00:02:39,870 --> 00:02:41,290
你的服装呢  汤米
Where's your costume, Tommy?

60
00:02:41,290 --> 00:02:44,320
这就是我的服装  我是双胞胎里酷的那个
This is my costume. I'm the cool twin.

61
00:02:44,350 --> 00:02:46,050
那我是什么
What does that make me?

62
00:02:50,610 --> 00:02:51,940
呆呆龙
A dorksaurus rex.

63
00:02:51,940 --> 00:02:53,810
没有那种恐龙
Not a real dinosaur. 

64
00:02:55,210 --> 00:02:56,390
天啊
Man.

65
00:02:56,890 --> 00:02:59,130
他打鼾都那么酷
He even snores cool.

66
00:02:59,430 --> 00:03:01,860
-我要吵醒他  -别
- I'm gonna go wake him up. - Don't!

67
00:03:02,850 --> 00:03:04,380
你怕了吗
You scared?

68
00:03:05,350 --> 00:03:07,400
他是我们的舅舅  我怎么会怕
He's our uncle. Why would I be scared?

69
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:09,130
因为现在是下午四点
'Cause it's four o'clock in the afternoon.

70
00:03:09,130 --> 00:03:11,540
你偷偷担心他是个吸血鬼
You're secretly afraid he's a vampire.

71
00:03:11,540 --> 00:03:13,020
-我没有  -你就有
- No, I'm not. - Yes, you are.

72
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:14,180
我没有
No, I'm not.

73
00:03:14,180 --> 00:03:17,650
血浓于水  我给你们看吧
Blood is thicker than water! I show you!

74
00:03:26,570 --> 00:03:31,190
最好是有人流血  摔坏或者着火了
Somebody better be bleeding, broken, or on fire.

75
00:03:31,190 --> 00:03:34,880
妈妈  你是老红帽吗
Mom. Are you old Red Riding Hood?

76
00:03:35,740 --> 00:03:37,670
我是一名索科威亚算命师
I'm a Sokovian fortune teller.

77
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:40,490
那真是太...
That is so...

78
00:03:40,490 --> 00:03:41,950
-酷了  -蠢了
- Rad. - ...lame.

79
00:03:41,950 --> 00:03:43,050
是"蠢"
"Lame."

80
00:03:43,670 --> 00:03:46,550
比我们得伤寒那年妈妈给我们做的服装还难看
Worse than the costumes mom made us the year we got typhus.

81
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:48,590
{\an8}不给糖就捣蛋

82
00:03:50,590 --> 00:03:52,150
{\an8}要分享哦

83
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:57,300
我印象里可不是那样
That's not exactly how I remember it.

84
00:03:57,300 --> 00:03:59,480
你可能压抑了很多创伤
You probably suppressed a lot of the trauma.

85
00:04:01,290 --> 00:04:04,210
皮特舅舅来后  妈妈就一直怪怪的
Mom has been weird since Uncle Pietro got here.

86
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:06,810
我觉得是因为她好久没见他了
I think it's because she hasn't seen him in a long time.

87
00:04:06,810 --> 00:04:10,260
而且他就是所谓的"大男孩"
And he's what you call, "A man child."

88
00:04:12,970 --> 00:04:15,940
好服装啊  妹夫
Sweet costume bro-ham-in-law.

89
00:04:15,940 --> 00:04:19,310
我猜猜  交通灯
Let me guess. Uh, traffic light.

90
00:04:19,910 --> 00:04:21,300
剥了一半的玉米
Half-shucked corn.

91
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:23,450
鼻屎
A booger!

92
00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:25,270
-对了  -棒
- Yes. - Yes!

93
00:04:25,270 --> 00:04:26,970
谢谢你迁就我
Well, thank you for humoring me

94
00:04:26,970 --> 00:04:29,300
穿得这么滑稽  亲爱的
and wearing this ridiculous get-up, honey.

95
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:32,160
我的衣橱里没有其他衣服了  所以
Well, there were no other clothes in my closet, so...

96
00:04:34,490 --> 00:04:36,680
你真不可救药  亲爱的
You are incorrigible, darling.

97
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:40,000
我知道你偷偷喜欢墨西哥摔跤手
I know you have a secret thing for Mexican wrestlers.

98
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,090
我好喜欢
Mi gusta mucho.

墨西哥辣肉酱
Chili con carne.

100
00:04:45,850 --> 00:04:46,710
怎么样  孩子们
What do you say, boys?

101
00:04:46,710 --> 00:04:50,080
谁准备好吃第一口高果糖玉米糖浆了
Who's ready for that first hit of high fructose corn syrup?

102
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:52,430
-锁头了  -快走开
- Yes! Headlock! - Get out of here, get out of here.

103
00:04:52,460 --> 00:04:53,920
你没怎么跟我讲过你哥哥
Never told me much about your brother.

104
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:55,810
没想到他这么...
I had no idea he'd be so...

105
00:04:55,810 --> 00:04:56,930

108
00:05:06,110 --> 00:05:08,660
那你今晚开心了  亲爱的
Well, you have fun tonight, darling.

109
00:05:08,660 --> 00:05:12,080
什么  什么意思  你不都穿好要走了吗
What? What do you mean? You're all dressed and ready to go.

110
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:13,790
我在卧底

112

你可没说你有安排了

我现在说了

Now we know who we're dealing with.

145
00:07:14,010 --> 00:07:15,320

Hey, there he is.

146
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:18,480
差点被自己的杀人小队杀掉的人
The guy who almost got murdered by his own murder squad.

147
00:07:21,430 --> 00:07:22,750
你为我工作吗
You work for me?

148
00:07:23,070 --> 00:07:25,320
-我还真不知道  -她是我的人
- I actually don't know. - She's with me.

149
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:28,100
这样啊  你们哪个是嘴上不饶人的闺蜜
I see. And which one of you is the sassy best friend?

150
00:07:28,110 --> 00:07:30,710
你没功夫贬低同事了
There is no time for you to diminish your colleagues

151
00:07:30,710 --> 00:07:32,760
你就要掀起一场你赢不了的战争了
when you're about to start a war you can't win.

152
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:34,810
马克西莫夫本就不可能跟我们谈判
Maximoff was never gonna negotiate with us.

153
00:07:34,810 --> 00:07:37,100
我们干掉她  这整个噩梦才会结束
We take her out, this whole nightmare ends.

154
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:38,410
这不好说
We don't know that.

155
00:07:38,410 --> 00:07:40,420
我们根本不知道
We actually have no idea

156
00:07:40,420 --> 00:07:45,180
如果旺达死了  那里和这里都会发生什么
what will happen in there or out here if Wanda dies.

157
00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:48,380
怎么  我们就对它投降吗
So, what? We just surrender to that?

158
00:07:48,380 --> 00:07:49,600
绝不可能
Not happening.

159
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:51,310
我们打不过她
We can't outgun her.

160
00:07:51,310 --> 00:07:54,880
显然  跟她对立只让事情更糟了
And clearly antagonizing her is only making things worse.

161
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:58,900
如果旺达是问题所在  那解铃还须系铃人
If Wanda is the problem, she has to be our solution.

162
00:07:58,900 --> 00:08:02,250
兰博上尉  你已经成了此次任务的阻碍
Captain Rambeau, you have become an impediment to this mission.

163
00:08:02,910 --> 00:08:07,130
总是替超能力人士说话
Constantly advocating on behalf of super-powered individuals.

164
00:08:07,130 --> 00:08:10,300
是啊  我清楚你跟卡罗尔·丹弗斯的渊源
Yes, I know your history with Carol Danvers.

165
00:08:10,590 --> 00:08:12,430
你们那些离开的人
You know, you people who left,

166
00:08:12,430 --> 00:08:14,930
仍可以奢侈地保持乐观
still have the luxury of optimism.

167
00:08:16,020 --> 00:08:18,130
你根本无法想象我们的情况
You have no idea what it was like.

168
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:20,800
为了持续下去都需要付出什么
What it took to keep the lights on.

169
00:08:21,130 --> 00:08:25,470
别拿过去五年作为懦弱的借口
Don't use the last five years as an excuse to be a coward.

170
00:08:28,210 --> 00:08:31,250
或许你母亲死时你没在也是好事
Maybe it's a good thing you weren't here when your mother died.

171
00:08:32,180 --> 00:08:35,570
因为你显然没有做这份工作的勇气
Because clearly you don't have the stomach for this job.

172
00:08:38,010 --> 00:08:42,450
带她离开我的基地  马上  把他们都带走
Get her off my base. Now. All of 'em.

173
00:08:43,180 --> 00:08:44,830
好了  走吧
All right. Come on. Let's go.

174
00:08:48,130 --> 00:08:51,110
海沃德的行事已经远超了他的临时权力
Hayward is way overstepping his provisional authority.

175
00:08:51,110 --> 00:08:53,480
他就想找个理由排挤走我们
He was looking for a reason to sideline us.

176
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:54,710
他有什么计划
He's up to something.

177
00:08:54,710 --> 00:08:56,570
走  都进去
Let's go. Everybody in!

178
00:09:07,670 --> 00:09:09,860
怎么没人把计划告诉我
Why didn't anyone tell me the plan?

179
00:09:09,860 --> 00:09:12,670
-你没事吧  -嗯  走吧
- You okay? - Yeah. Let's move.

180
00:09:24,770 --> 00:09:28,170
{\an8}天剑局

181
00:09:30,510 --> 00:09:32,690
好了  游戏时间到
This is it. Game time.

182
00:09:32,690 --> 00:09:34,470
这又不是比赛  汤米
It's not a competition, Tommy.

183
00:09:34,470 --> 00:09:36,410
-你赢了不就是了  -汤米
- It is if you're a winner. - Tommy.

184
00:09:36,410 --> 00:09:38,710
掀起地狱腥风吧  恶魔之子
Unleash hell, demon spawn.

185
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:44,000
你记得爸爸妈妈死后我们在
Do you remember when we were at the orphanage

186
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,090
孤儿院时吗
after mom and dad died?

187
00:09:45,090 --> 00:09:47,510
那个总想
What was the name of that

188
00:09:47,510 --> 00:09:49,450
偷你靴子的小孩叫什么来着
kid who was always trying to steal your boots?

189
00:09:49,450 --> 00:09:53,030
就是那个...皮肤有问题的
You know, he was the one... He had the... He had the skin thing.

190
00:09:53,110 --> 00:09:54,760
你在考我
You're testing me.

191
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:55,810
我没有
No, I'm not.

192
00:09:55,820 --> 00:09:59,150
没事  我知道我变样了
Hey, it's cool. I know I look different.

193
00:09:59,150 --> 00:10:02,490
你为什么...变样了
Why do you... look different?

194
00:10:02,490 --> 00:10:05,220
你说呢  如果我找到了仙境
You tell me. I mean, if I found Shangri-La,

195
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:07,390
我也不会想被提醒过去的样子
I wouldn't wanna be reminded of the past either.

196
00:10:09,340 --> 00:10:10,710
下一家  妈妈
Next house, Mom.

197
00:10:10,710 --> 00:10:12,340
这是个小企业家啊
Junior entrepreneur, over here.

198
00:10:12,350 --> 00:10:13,030
让你的皮舅舅
How about you let Uncle P

199
00:10:13,030 --> 00:10:15,510
帮你最大化糖果收购吧
help you maximize your candy acquisition, huh?

200
00:10:15,510 --> 00:10:16,740
好啊  海扁
Yeah. Kick-ass!

201
00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:17,770
"我觉得需要..."
"I feel the need..."

202
00:10:17,770 --> 00:10:19,180
"速度"
"For speed."

203
00:10:20,090 --> 00:10:21,570
海扁
Kick-ass.

204
00:10:23,430 --> 00:10:24,800
好啊  赫
Oh, hey, Herb.

205
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:26,830
巡逻得如何了
How's patrol going?

206
00:10:26,830 --> 00:10:30,890
目前很平静  等一下
Eh, quiet, so far. Hold up, will you?

207
00:10:30,990 --> 00:10:32,230
再说一遍
Say again.

208
00:10:33,550 --> 00:10:35,440
所有糖果都消失了吗
All the candy has disappeared?

209
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:37,690
什么  谁把我的糖抢走了
What? Who took my candy?

210
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:42,410
现在所有南瓜灯都被砸了
And now all the jack-o'-lanterns have been smashed.

211
00:10:46,370 --> 00:10:49,090
现在大家身上全都是傻兮兮的飘带吗
And now everyone's covered in silly string?

212
00:10:53,750 --> 00:10:55,210
抱歉  旺达  我要走了
Sorry, Wanda, I gotta bounce.

213
00:10:55,210 --> 00:10:57,420
也许幻视可以帮你
Well, maybe Vision can help you out.

214
00:10:57,420 --> 00:10:59,720
幻视  他今天不值班
Vision? Oh, he's not on duty.

215
00:10:59,730 --> 00:11:03,890
我...我以为他...
Oh! I... I thought he...

216
00:11:03,890 --> 00:11:06,160
你需要我做什么吗  旺达
Is there something I can do for you, Wanda?

217
00:11:06,180 --> 00:11:09,110
你想改变些什么吗
Do you want something changed?

218
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:14,080
不  没事  没关系
No. It's fine. Never mind.

219
00:11:14,250 --> 00:11:15,900
好  安了
All right. Peace.

220
00:11:21,290 --> 00:11:22,960
你好啊
Hey! How's it going?

221
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:24,970
万圣节快乐
Happy Halloween.

222
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:09,070
我好饿  我什么都会吃
I'm so hungry, I'd eat anything.

223
00:12:12,030 --> 00:12:14,020
饿了吗  我记得饥饿的感觉
Hungry? I remember hungry.

224
00:12:14,020 --> 00:12:16,290
我以前经常很饿
I used to be like that all the time.

225
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:17,620
然后你做了什么
What did you do?

226
00:12:17,620 --> 00:12:19,790
来点魔法酸奶  哥们儿
Snacked on Yo-Magic, bro.

{\an8}全新

228
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:22,050
我现在都有时间翅翅玩玩了
Now I have time to hang fin.

229
00:12:22,530 --> 00:12:23,890
能给我来点吗
Can I have some?

230
00:12:23,890 --> 00:12:25,720
给  小家伙
Here you go, little dude.

232
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:46,440
魔法酸奶  生存者专用零食

233
00:12:43,030 --> 00:12:45,850
{\an8}全新

234
00:12:47,170 --> 00:12:49,250
{\an8}皇冠影院
《超人特工队》
《天生一对》

235
00:12:50,740 --> 00:12:52,430
太扫兴了
This is so lame. 

236
00:12:52,430 --> 00:12:54,450
真不敢相信你逼他们把糖都还回去了
I can't believe you're making them return all the candy.

237
00:12:54,450 --> 00:12:56,520
真不敢相信你竟然做了这么坏的榜样
I can't believe what a bad influence you are.

238
00:12:56,520 --> 00:12:58,440
你吃错什么药了
Who beefed in your borscht?

239
00:12:58,870 --> 00:13:01,140
我只是想做我该做的事
I'm just trying to do my part, okay?

240
00:13:01,140 --> 00:13:02,270
突然出现在镇上
Come to town unexpectedly,

241
00:13:02,270 --> 00:13:03,450
和我的妹夫产生矛盾
create tension with the brother-in-law,

242
00:13:03,450 --> 00:13:06,610
跟孩子们一起惹麻烦  最后惹你难过
stir up trouble with the rugrats, and ultimately give you grief.

243
00:13:06,610 --> 00:13:10,000
这不就是你想要的吗
I mean, that's what you wanted, isn't it?

244
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:12,330
你的口音怎么回事
What happened to your accent?

245
00:13:12,330 --> 00:13:13,920
你的又是怎么回事
What happened to yours?

246
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:16,930
细节太模糊了
Details are fuzzy, man.

247
00:13:17,340 --> 00:13:20,640
我在街上莫名其妙被人打了一枪
I got shot like a chump on the street for no reason at all

248
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:23,480
然后我好像就听到了你的召唤
and the next thing I know, I heard you calling me.

249
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:26,430
我知道你需要我
I knew you needed me.

250
00:13:27,610 --> 00:13:28,760
皮舅舅  你猜怎么着
Uncle P, guess what?

251
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:32,840
几个街区外在发大块糖果  妈妈  我们能去吗
They've got full-size candy bars a few blocks up. Mom, can we go?

252
00:13:33,370 --> 00:13:35,380
下一站  蛀牙小镇
Next stop, Cavity Town.

253
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:37,060
好嘞  小家伙
Right on, little dude.

254
00:13:37,060 --> 00:13:38,710
有老舅必有小外甥
Chip off the old Maximoff block.

255

257
00:13:41,810 --> 00:13:42,690
没事的  宝贝
It's okay, baby.

258
00:13:42,690 --> 00:13:45,110
你可以慢点  你也可以...
You can take it slow, and you can--

259
00:13:53,190 --> 00:13:55,060
如果你要突破音速屏障
If you're gonna break the sound barrier,

260
00:13:55,060 --> 00:13:56,470
请带上你的兄弟一起
please just take your brother with you.

261
00:13:56,470 --> 00:13:57,860
-真的吗  -真的吗
- Really? - Really?

262
00:13:57,860 --> 00:14:01,500
真的  以及拜托你们记住
Really. Yeah. And please just remember to--

263
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:03,800
不要越过艾利斯大道
Don't go past Ellis Avenue.

264
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:05,750
我们知道  妈妈  我们知道
We know, Mom. We know.

265
00:14:05,750 --> 00:14:07,380
小心点
Hey! Be careful.

266
00:14:19,050 --> 00:14:21,040
我只是想做我该做的事
I'm just trying to do my part, okay?

267
00:14:21,050 --> 00:14:22,130
突然出现在镇上
Come to town unexpectedly,

268
00:14:22,130 --> 00:14:24,010
和我的妹夫产生矛盾
create tension with the brother-in-law...

269
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:25,960
那是谁啊
Who is that?

270
00:14:26,290 --> 00:14:28,150
旺达的哥哥来到了镇上
Wanda's brother came to town.

271
00:14:28,620 --> 00:14:30,110
他的脸不对
He brought the wrong face.

272
00:14:30,110 --> 00:14:31,090
这边
Over here.

273
00:14:31,090 --> 00:14:34,290
-你的口音怎么回事  -你的又是怎么回事
- What happened to your accent? - What happened to yours?

274
00:14:35,450 --> 00:14:36,770
我们不该在这里待太久
We shouldn't hang out here too long.

275
00:14:36,780 --> 00:14:38,210
给我两秒钟
Uh, give me two seconds.

276
00:14:38,210 --> 00:14:41,870
我需要黑进基地的安全网络
I just need to hack into the secure network on the base.

277
00:14:42,810 --> 00:14:44,050

Donezo.

278
00:14:44,050 --> 00:14:48,460
好了  应该可以接触到
Now, should be able to access the data 

279
00:14:48,460 --> 00:14:50,420
海沃德装置上的数据了
on Hayward's devices.

280
00:14:52,390 --> 00:14:55,040
有点意思
Oh. That's interesting.

281
00:14:55,070 --> 00:14:58,670
伙计们  海沃德有办法看到边界内
Guys, Hayward figured out a way to look through the boundary.

282
00:14:58,670 --> 00:15:00,970
但是他却没有告诉组里的人吗
And he didn't share it with the group.

283
00:15:03,470 --> 00:15:04,970
这是旺达吗
Is this Wanda, right here?

284
00:15:05,550 --> 00:15:09,360
不  这个项目在追踪振金的衰变特征
No. The program is tracking the decay signature of vibranium.

285
00:15:09,710 --> 00:15:11,820
是幻视  等等
Vision. Wait.

286
00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:13,620
海伍德为什么要追踪幻视
Why is Hayward tracking Vision?

287
00:15:13,620 --> 00:15:15,670
我不知道  我目前只有这个权限
I don't know. This is all I can access so far.

288
00:15:15,670 --> 00:15:18,070
那这些点是西景居民吗
These other dots, those are Westview residents?

289
00:15:18,070 --> 00:15:19,920
紧挨着幻视的那些是的
The ones in Vision's immediate vicinity, yeah.

290
00:15:19,930 --> 00:15:22,860
那海沃德现在肯定知道准确人数了
So Hayward must have an accurate headcount by now.

291
00:15:23,270 --> 00:15:25,770
也差不多了解他们的状况了
And some sense of their well-being.

292
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:30,400
这些在镇边缘的人
These people, near the edge of town...

293
00:15:30,410 --> 00:15:32,090
他们几乎一动不动
They're barely moving.

294
00:15:32,190 --> 00:15:33,730
他们还活着吗
Are they alive?

295
00:15:38,150 --> 00:15:39,900
{\an8}人物重连中

296
00:16:05,550 --> 00:16:07,270
打扰一下
Say, excuse me.

297
00:16:09,410 --> 00:16:10,520
女士
Ma'am?

298
00:16:13,710 --> 00:16:15,280
他们是你家孩子吗
Are those your children?

299
00:16:17,670 --> 00:16:19,510
你在等什么吗
Are you waiting for something?

300
00:17:09,060 --> 00:17:10,650
万圣节快乐
Happy Halloween!

301
00:17:12,380 --> 00:17:13,640
不给糖就捣蛋
Trick-or-treat?

302
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:44,660
艾格妮丝
Agnes?

303
00:17:50,370 --> 00:17:51,920
你在这干什么
What are you doing here?

304
00:17:54,170 --> 00:17:58,110
镇广场吓人大会在哪
Town Square Scare. Where is it?

305
00:17:58,730 --> 00:18:03,730
在镇广场吧  应该是
Oh, well, the Town Square. I expect.

306
00:18:06,970 --> 00:18:08,610
转错弯了
Took a wrong turn.

307
00:18:10,420 --> 00:18:11,920
迷路了
Got lost.

308
00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:15,900
可你不就是在这个镇上长大的吗
In the town you grew up in?

309
00:18:28,100 --> 00:18:29,270
没事的
It's all right.

310
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:32,130
你...
You...

311
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:35,700
你是复仇者
You're one of the Avengers.

312
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:37,110
你是幻视
You're Vision.

313
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:40,190
你是来救我们的吗
Are you here to help us?

314
00:18:40,190 --> 00:18:43,090
我确实是幻视  我确实想帮忙
I am Vision. I do want to help.

315
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:45,400
但复仇者是什么
But what's an Avenger?

316
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:46,830
什么
What?

317
00:18:47,820 --> 00:18:49,250
你怎么会不知道
Why don't you know?

318
00:18:56,020 --> 00:18:57,170
我死了吗
Am I dead?

319
00:18:57,170 --> 00:19:01,000
没有  你怎么会那么想
No, no. Why would you think that?

320
00:19:01,490 --> 00:19:02,990
因为你死了
Because you are.

321
00:19:04,330 --> 00:19:05,720
因为我什么
'Cause I'm what?

322
00:19:06,530 --> 00:19:07,650
死了
Dead.

323
00:19:08,410 --> 00:19:09,510
死了
Dead.

324
00:19:10,670 --> 00:19:11,760
死了
Dead!

325
00:19:12,690 --> 00:19:13,790
死了
Dead!

326
00:19:14,530 --> 00:19:19,530
艾格尼丝  我想联系西景镇外界
Agnes, it is my intention to reach those outside of Westview

327
00:19:19,530 --> 00:19:21,710
弄清我们现在的状况
and make sense of our situation.

328
00:19:22,670 --> 00:19:24,040
怎么做
How?

329
00:19:25,740 --> 00:19:27,410
谁都不能离开
No one leaves.

330
00:19:29,170 --> 00:19:31,590
旺达都不许我们想这事
Wanda won't even let us think about it.

331
00:19:36,270 --> 00:19:38,240
全完了
All is lost.

332
00:19:38,270 --> 00:19:39,510
艾格尼丝
Agnes...

333
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:41,370
艾格尼丝  冷静一下
Agnes, please calm down.

334
00:19:41,370 --> 00:19:43,870
艾格尼丝  求你别这样...
Agnes! Please...

335
00:19:48,970 --> 00:19:51,660
我会解决的  艾格尼丝  我保证
I will fix this, Agnes. I promise.

336
00:19:54,750 --> 00:19:56,770
好啊  邻居
Okey-dokey, neighbor.

337
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:10,790
万圣节愉快哟
Happy Halloweenie!

338
00:20:10,070 --> 00:20:40,150
{\an8}艾利斯大道

339
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:43,350
{\an8}医疗记录  莫妮卡·兰博

340
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:49,080
来了
That's it.

341
00:20:49,420 --> 00:20:52,520
我回到六边域的办法一小时就到
My way back into the Hex will be here in an hour.

342
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:54,860
得去山那边跟我的朋友碰头
Just gotta meet my guy over the ridge.

343
00:20:54,910 --> 00:20:56,400
行动吧
Let's roll.

344
00:20:56,740 --> 00:20:57,740
你们不能那样做
You can't do that.

345
00:20:57,740 --> 00:21:00,100
当然能  我是短路点火的专家
Sure we can. I'm a whiz at hot-wiring cars.

346
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:01,540
你们不能回到六边域里
You can't go back into the Hex.

347
00:21:01,540 --> 00:21:02,330
最糟糕的情况是
Worst case scenario,

348
00:21:02,330 --> 00:21:06,470
旺达除掉我的自由意志  让我穿上超低腰牛仔裤
Wanda removes my free will and puts me in ultra-low-rise jeans.

349
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:08,470
海沃德给你做了血液检查
Hayward has your blood work.

350
00:21:11,610 --> 00:21:13,820
你已经进入边界两次了  莫妮卡
You've gone through the boundary twice already, Monica.

351
00:21:13,830 --> 00:21:16,430
里面的能量在分子层面上
The energy inside has re-written your cells

352
00:21:16,430 --> 00:21:18,630
两次改写了你的细胞
on a molecular level twice.

353
00:21:18,630 --> 00:21:20,510
它在改变你
It's changing you.

354
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:24,890
我看过够一辈子量的化验报告了
Seen enough lab results to last me a lifetime.

355
00:21:25,050 --> 00:21:29,100
细胞转移  细胞缓解
Cells metastasizing, cells in remission.

356
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:35,050
我知道旺达的感受  不帮到她我不罢休
I know what Wanda's feeling and I won't stop until I help her.

357
00:21:37,900 --> 00:21:38,960
好吧
Okay.

358
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:41,480
好
Okay.

359
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:44,330
但我要留在这
But I'm staying here.

360
00:21:44,790 --> 00:21:45,710
你不能留在这
You can't stay here.

361
00:21:45,710 --> 00:21:47,840
-这里不安全  -达西  你说什么
- It's not safe. - What? Darcy, what are you talkin' about?

362
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:49,750
我还没突破海沃德的最后一道防火墙
I haven't made it through Hayward's last firewall.

363
00:21:49,750 --> 00:21:50,900
里面肯定有重要的东西
There's something big here.

364
00:21:50,900 --> 00:21:53,030
能帮到我们的东西  我能肯定
Something that can help us. I know it.

365
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:58,360
好吧
Fine. Fine.

366
00:21:58,520 --> 00:22:00,160
我发给你地点
I'll drop you the location,

367
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:02,560
你尽快到那里跟我们会合
you meet us out there as soon as you can.

368
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:32,520
老天爷啊
Holy shmacaroni.

369
00:22:33,630 --> 00:22:34,480
是不是很热闹
Isn't it great?

370
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:37,460
新泽西州西景镇真是魅力天堂
Damn it, if Westview, New Jersey isn't charming as hell.

371
00:22:37,460 --> 00:22:40,930
我知道你肯定觉得我变成足球妈妈了
Now, I know that you think that I've have gone full soccer mom.

372
00:22:37,460 --> 00:22:40,930
{\an8}特指花许多时间带孩子参加各种活动的妈妈

373
00:22:40,930 --> 00:22:45,430
-没错  -但是这真的很棒  对吗
- Yeah. - But it really is nice, right?

374
00:22:45,990 --> 00:22:47,110
对
Yeah.

375
00:22:49,910 --> 00:22:52,500
我觉得爸爸妈妈肯定会喜欢的
I think Mom and Dad would've loved it.

376
00:22:53,930 --> 00:22:57,930
是的  我觉得也是
Yeah. I think they would have.

377
00:23:02,130 --> 00:23:04,130
你之前都把这些孩子藏在哪儿了
Where were you hiding these kids up till now?

378
00:23:04,140 --> 00:23:04,930
-什么  -我猜
- What? - I assume

379
00:23:04,930 --> 00:23:07,250
他们都一直乖乖地在床上睡觉呢
they were sleeping peacefully in their beds.

380
00:23:07,250 --> 00:23:08,430
除了偶尔在节日里跑跑龙套
No need to traumatize beyond

381
00:23:08,430 --> 00:23:10,430
没必要给他们造成更多创伤了  是不是
the occasional holiday episode cameo, right?

382
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:11,970
-不  -你一直都是双胞胎中更有同理心的那个
- No... - You were always the empathetic twin.

383
00:23:11,970 --> 00:23:14,350
-不  我没  -别误会我
- I don't... I didn't... - Don't get me wrong.

384
00:23:14,350 --> 00:23:15,600
你对这个情况的伦理问题
You've handled the ethical considerations

385
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:17,370
处理得尽量好了
of this scenario as best you could.

386
00:23:17,370 --> 00:23:19,040
家人和夫妻都待在一起
Families and couples stay together,

387
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:20,810
大部分人的性格都和本质相差不大
most personalities aren't far off from what's underneath,

388
00:23:20,810 --> 00:23:22,570
人们的工作都更好
people got better jobs,

389
00:23:22,830 --> 00:23:24,620
毫无疑问  发型也更棒
better haircuts, for sure.

390
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:28,700
你不觉得这是错的
You don't think it's wrong?

391
00:23:29,010 --> 00:23:29,960
什么  你在开玩笑吗
What, are you kidding?

392
00:23:29,970 --> 00:23:32,250
说真的  我感觉很震撼
I'm impressed! Seriously.

393
00:23:32,250 --> 00:23:33,880
从给人们带来噩梦和从手里发射红色法术
It's a big leap from giving people nightmares

394
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:36,160
到变成这样  可是一个很大的飞跃呢
and shooting red wiggly-woos out of your hands.

395
00:23:39,050 --> 00:23:41,160
你到底是怎么做到这些的
How'd you even do all this?

396
00:23:44,060 --> 00:23:47,260
我不是什么陌生人
Hey, I'm not some stranger

397
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:49,780
我也不是你的丈夫
and I'm not your husband.

398
00:23:52,190 --> 00:23:53,550
你可以和我聊聊
You can talk to me.

399
00:24:01,300 --> 00:24:04,270
我不知道我是怎么做到的
I don't know how I did it.

400
00:24:05,820 --> 00:24:06,990
我
I...

401
00:24:07,980 --> 00:24:12,980
我只记得我感觉非常孤独
I only remember feeling completely alone.

402
00:24:15,330 --> 00:24:17,620
非常空虚  我只是
Empty. I just...

403
00:24:19,850 --> 00:24:21,900
永无止境的虚无
Endless nothingness.

404
00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:36,320
你还好吗
Are you okay?

405
00:24:38,740 --> 00:24:40,050
我没事
I'm fine.

406
00:24:48,570 --> 00:24:49,710
{\an8}视障  秘密武器

407
00:24:50,190 --> 00:24:52,210
{\an8}绝密  海沃德·T

408
00:24:50,910 --> 00:24:54,000
海沃德  你这个卑鄙的混蛋
Hayward, you sneaky bastard.

409
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:58,610
{\an8}收件人  詹姆斯·吴  联调局

410
00:25:09,530 --> 00:25:10,700
开始行动
Move out.

411
00:25:12,830 --> 00:25:16,940
是幻视  他在干什么
Vision. What's he doing?

412
00:25:16,990 --> 00:25:20,180
{\an8}振金

413
00:26:33,630 --> 00:26:35,760
他是真的想出来  是不是
He really does want out, doesn't he?

414
00:26:47,750 --> 00:26:48,920
不好
Oh, no.

415
00:26:50,510 --> 00:26:52,160
你们为什么不帮帮他
Why aren't you helping him?

416
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:54,130
停下  他开始碎裂了
Stop! He's coming apart!

417
00:27:04,510 --> 00:27:06,300
他是真的想出来  是不是
He really does want out doesn't he?

418
00:27:09,830 --> 00:27:12,210
比利
Whoa, Billy!

419
00:27:12,450 --> 00:27:13,740
你怎么了
Are you okay?

420
00:27:15,050 --> 00:27:16,130
妈妈
Mom!

421
00:27:17,510 --> 00:27:20,550
妈妈  妈妈  妈妈
Mom! Mom! Mom! Mom!

422
00:27:20,550 --> 00:27:22,150
什么  怎么了  比利
What? What is it, Billy?

423
00:27:22,150 --> 00:27:26,070
我在脑子里听见了爸爸的声音  他出事了
